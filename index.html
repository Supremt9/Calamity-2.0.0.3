    <h1>Calamity 2.0.0.3</h1>
    <p>The newest version of the mod when Malice difficulty wasn't removed. I'm not the creator of the mod and not trying to and I'm not trying to present myself as the creator or current owner. The official page on Steam - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824688072

Since github doesn't allow me to upload files 25mb+ i'll upload them at other platforms

Instruction:

After the latest Calamity mod version was installed they should be disabled. After that press Open Mods Folder
Downloaded files contain numbers, copy and past them in search bar of the Explorer.
After the folders was found, open one of them and click on one of the folders it contain (example name: 2022.9) it will display the mod name - now you know which mod should be in that folder. After that come back the main folder and delete everything inside.
